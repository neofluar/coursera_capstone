    "According to www.food.gov.uk, there are more than 14,000 restaurants in London and about 9 million people. That is why opening a new restaurant there can be an extremely challenging task. Choosing a restaurant type and a good spot, an entrepreneur usually carelessly relies on common sense and domain knowledge. Needless to say that too often an inconsiderate decision leads to a poor income and inevitable bankruptcy. According to several surveys, up to 40% of such start-ups fail in the very first year. Let's suppose, an investor has enough time and money, as well as a passion to open the best eating spot in London. What type of restaurant would it be? What would be the best place for it? Is there a better way to answer these questions rather than guessing?  \n",
    "What if there is a way to cluster city neighborhoods, based on their near-by restaurant similarity? What if we can visualize these clusters on a map? What if we might find what type of restaurant is the most and least popular in each location? Equipped with that knowledge, we might be able to make a smart choice from a huge number of restaurant types and available places.  \n",
    "Let us allow machine learning to get the job done. Using reliable venue data, it can investigate the city neighborhoods, and show us unseen dependencies. Dependencies that we are not aware of.\n"

    "_In my opinion, the stakeholder should prefer the least popular types as a safe choice. There is no sense in opening the second pizzeria in the same building. Of course, there might be more than 10 types in a location. And one might object, that following this logic, the stakeholder must prefer the last type in a full list, and not the 10th one. But bear in mind that descending on the popularity list we might face an absence of demand for this type of food, and open a restaurant that is not needed in this particular location. Presence of interested customers is a must for a successful business. That is why I offer to stop on 8th, 9th, or 10th positions. Anyway, this is a discussion matter._  \n",
